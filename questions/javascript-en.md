**Falsy values in JavaScript:**

In JavaScript, falsy values are values that are considered false when evaluated in a logical context. These values are:

1. `false`: The boolean value false.
2. `0`: The number zero.
3. `''`: The empty string.
4. `null`: A special value indicating the absence of any object.
5. `undefined`: A value that signifies an uninitialized variable or a missing property.
6. `NaN`: A special value indicating "Not-a-Number" and occurs when an invalid mathematical operation is performed.
7. `document.all`: A special object created for compatibility with Internet Explorer.
8. `-0`: Negative zero.
9. `0n`: BigInt zero.

When these values are encountered in a logical expression, they are automatically converted to `false`. It is important to note that all other values in JavaScript are considered "truthy" and evaluate to `true` in a logical context.

**Differences between `const`, `let`, and `var` in JavaScript:**

1. `var`: `var` was the original way of declaring variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with `var` have function scope or are global, depending on whether they are declared inside a function or outside any function block. `var` variables can be redeclared and reassigned within their scope, and during JavaScript runtime, they are hoisted to the beginning of their scope.

2. `let`: `let` was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) as a block-scoped variable declaration. Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are limited to the block (defined by `{}`) in which they are defined. Unlike `var`, variables declared with `let` cannot be redeclared within the same scope, but they can be assigned a new value.

3. `const`: `const` was also added in ES6 and is used to declare constants that cannot be reassigned after their definition. Like `let`, `const` has block scope and cannot be redeclared within the same scope. However, it's important to note that `const` does not guarantee immutability of the variable; it only prevents reassignment. If a `const` variable holds an object or an array, their properties or elements can still be modified.

In general, it is recommended to use `const` for variables that are not intended to be reassigned, `let` for variables that need to be reassigned, and in modern JavaScript development, it is advised to avoid using `var` due to its less predictable scoping behavior.

**Difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript:**

The question pertains to the difference between two comparison operators in JavaScript: `==` (double equals) and `===` (triple equals).

- `==` (double equals) is a comparison operator that performs non-strict equality comparison. This means that before the comparison, automatic type conversion takes place if the compared values are of different types. For example, `5 == "5"` would return `true` because the values are equivalent, even though one is a number and the other is a string.

- `===` (triple equals) is a comparison operator that performs strict equality comparison. It compares both the values and the data types. For example, `5 === "5"` would return `false` because they differ in both value and type.

It is generally recommended to use `===` (strict equality) most of the time because it respects both the value and the data type, leading to more precise and expected comparison results.

**Difference between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript:**

In JavaScript, both `undefined` and `null` are special values that represent the absence of meaningful value. However, they are used in different contexts and have slight differences in their behavior:

1. `undefined`: When a variable is declared but no value is assigned to it, it has the default value of `undefined`. It also indicates the absence of a return value from a function or the absence of a defined property in an object. In other words, it signifies the absence of any assigned value or intentional value.

2. `null`: In contrast to `undefined`, `null` is an assigned value that signifies the absence of any object value. It is typically used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no value or is intentionally empty. It is often used when you want to clear the value of a variable or reset an object property to an empty state.

In summary, `undefined` is the default value when no value is assigned to a variable, while `null` is an explicit value that represents the absence of an object value. They serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios in JavaScript programming.

**What is the event loop?:**

The event loop is a task that keeps checking if there are any items in the callback queue and forwards them to the call stack but only when the call stack is empty.

**How do you create a deep copy?:**

We previously relied on the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(yourObjectHere)); hack (this is legacy information, you should not use it anymore but you may encounter it in some interview questions).

We can now use the structuredClone() function to create a deep copy.

**Different Data Types in JavaScript:**

Here is a list of several commonly used data types in JavaScript:

1. **Number**: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. For example, `5`, `3.14`, and `-10` are numbers.

2. **String**: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. For example, `'Hello'` and `"JavaScript"` are strings.

3. **Boolean**: Represents a logical value of either `true` or `false`. Booleans are often used in conditional expressions and comparisons.

4. **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each value can be of any data type. Objects are created using curly braces `{}` and can be accessed and manipulated using dot notation (`object.property`) or bracket notation (`object['property']`).

5. **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value yet. It is the default value for uninitialized variables.

6. **Null**: Represents the deliberate absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or object property has no value.

7. **Symbol**: Represents a unique identifier. Symbols are often used as keys for object properties to prevent naming collisions.

8. **BigInt**: Represents integers of arbitrary precision. `BigInt` is used for precise representation and performing arithmetic operations on large integers.

These are some of the fundamental data types in JavaScript that provide basic building blocks for storing and manipulating data in JavaScript programs.

**Spread Operator (`...`) and Rest Parameter (`...`):**

The spread operator (`...`) and rest parameter (`...`) are features in JavaScript used for working with arrays and function arguments.

The spread operator (`...`) is used to expand an iterable object (such as an array or a string) into individual elements. It allows copying, concatenating, or cloning arrays and also passing multiple elements as arguments to a function.

The rest parameter (`...`) is used to represent an arbitrary number of arguments as an array. It allows passing multiple arguments to a function without explicitly defining each argument.

**Examples:**

```javascript
// Spread Operator - Copying arrays
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...originalArray];

// Spread Operator - Concatenating arrays
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];

// Spread Operator - Passing arguments
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const largestNumber = Math.max(...numbers);

// Rest Parameter - Function parameters
function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((total, number) => total + number, 0);
}
const result = sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Rest Parameter - Array destructuring
const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(first);   // 1
console.log(second);  // 2
console.log(rest);    // [3, 4, 5]
```

**What is Object and Array Destructuring and Why Might You Use It?**

Destructuring is a technique in JavaScript that allows for easy extraction of values from objects or arrays and assigning those values to separate variables. This technique simplifies access to individual elements and properties and facilitates data manipulation.

**Object Destructuring:**

Using object destructuring, you can extract the values of object properties and assign them to new variables with corresponding names. This way, you can quickly access the values of an object and use them easily in your code.

```javascript
const object = { name: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30 };
const { name, lastName, age } = object;

console.log(name);       // 'John'
console.log(lastName);   // 'Doe'
console.log(age);        // 30

```

- Code simplification: Destructuring simplifies accessing object values and array elements without manually accessing them using dot or bracket notation.
- Variable renaming: During destructuring, you can assign new variable names to object values or array elements, allowing for renaming without modifying the original data structure.
- Selective extraction: Destructuring allows you to extract only the values you need, disregarding the rest, which improves code efficiency and readability.

**What are Promises and why should you use them?**

**Promises** are asynchronous programming functions introduced in JavaScript for managing and coordinating asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may not be available immediately but will be resolved or rejected in the future.

Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable manner. Instead of relying on callback functions, which can lead to complicated code and the so-called "callback hell," Promises offer a structured approach to dealing with asynchronous tasks.

Here are some reasons why you should use Promises:

1. **Asynchronous operations**: Promises are ideal for handling asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API, reading from a file, or executing database queries. They allow you to process the outcome of these operations once they are resolved without blocking the execution of other tasks.

2. **Error handling**: Promises provide a built-in mechanism for error handling during asynchronous operations. You can attach a `.catch()` handler that will handle any errors that occur during the execution of the Promise, providing a centralized and consistent way of managing errors.

3. **Chaining and sequencing**: Promises can be chained using the `.then()` method, allowing you to perform a sequence of asynchronous operations one after another. This promotes clean and readable code compared to nested callbacks.

4. **Parallel execution**: Promises can be used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and wait for their completion using `Promise.all()`. This is useful when you need to perform several independent tasks concurrently.

5. **Composition**: Promises can be composed and combined using methods like `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, and `Promise.any()`. This enables more complex workflows and allows you to orchestrate multiple asynchronous tasks with different dependencies and outcomes.

Overall, Promises provide a structured and efficient way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, making the code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors. They are widely used in modern JavaScript applications and serve as the foundation for newer features like `async/await`.

**What does pass by value mean and how does it differ from pass by reference?**

Pass by value and pass by reference are two different ways of passing arguments to functions in programming languages.

In pass by value, a copy of the variable's value is passed to the function. Any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. This is the default behavior for primitive data types such as numbers, booleans, and strings. Changes made to the parameter inside the function are local to that function and do not impact the calling code.

In pass by reference, a reference or memory address of the variable is passed to the function. This means the function can directly access the original variable outside the function and modify it. Any changes made to the parameter inside the function will affect the original variable. Pass by reference is often used for complex data types such as objects and arrays.

Here's a summary of the differences between pass by value and pass by reference:

**Pass by value:**
- A copy of the value is passed to the function.
- Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable.
- Changes made to the parameter are local to the function.
- Used for primitive data types (numbers, booleans, strings).

**Pass by reference:**
- A reference or memory address of the variable is passed to the function.
- Changes made to the parameter inside the function affect the original variable.
- Changes made to the parameter reflect in the calling code.
- Used for complex data types (objects, arrays).

Understanding the difference between pass by value and pass by reference is important when working with functions and manipulating data in programming languages. It helps understand how data is shared and modified between different parts of the code.


```javascript
const prim = 5;

function add(value) {
    value++;

    return value;
}

console.log(add(prim), prim); // 6 5
```

```javascript

const ref = { count: 5 };

function add2(value) {
    value.count++;

    return value.count;
}

console.log(add2(ref), ref.count); // 6 6
```

**Expression in JavaScript:**

In JavaScript, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produces a result. It represents a computation or an action that can be evaluated to obtain a single value.

Here's an example of an expression in JavaScript:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 3;
let result = x + y * 2; // An arithmetic expression
```
